/**
 * A full-screen horizontally scrolling Pager optimized for Wear OS devices. This component wraps
 * the standard Compose Foundation [HorizontalPager] and provides Wear-specific enhancements to
 * improve performance, usability, and adherence to Wear OS design guidelines.
 *
 * Please refer to the samples to learn how to use this API.
 *
 * @sample androidx.wear.compose.foundation.samples.SimpleHorizontalPagerSample
 * @param state The state to control this pager
 * @param modifier A modifier instance to be applied to this Pager outer layout
 * @param contentPadding a padding around the whole content. This will add padding for the content
 *   after it has been clipped, which is not possible via [modifier] param. You can use it to add a
 *   padding before the first page or after the last one.
 * @param beyondViewportPageCount Pages to compose and layout before and after the list of visible
 *   pages. Note: Be aware that using a large value for [beyondViewportPageCount] will cause a lot
 *   of pages to be composed, measured and placed which will defeat the purpose of using lazy
 *   loading. This should be used as an optimization to pre-load a couple of pages before and after
 *   the visible ones. This does not include the pages automatically composed and laid out by the
 *   pre-fetcher in the direction of the scroll during scroll events.
 * @param flingBehavior The [TargetedFlingBehavior] to be used for post scroll gestures.
 * @param userScrollEnabled whether the scrolling via the user gestures or accessibility actions is
 *   allowed. You can still scroll programmatically using [PagerState.scroll] even when it is
 *   disabled.
 * @param reverseLayout reverse the direction of scrolling and layout.
 * @param key a stable and unique key representing the item. When you specify the key the scroll
 *   position will be maintained based on the key, which means if you add/remove items before the
 *   current visible item the item with the given key will be kept as the first visible one. If null
 *   is passed the position in the list will represent the key.
 * @param swipeToDismissEdgeZoneFraction A float which controls the size of the screen edge area
 *   used for the Wear system's swipe to dismiss gesture. This value, between 0 and 1, represents
 *   the fraction of the screen width that will be sensitive to the gesture. For example, 0.25 means
 *   the leftmost 25% of the screen will trigger the gesture. Even when RTL mode is enabled, this
 *   parameter only ever applies to the left edge of the screen. Setting this to 0 will disable the
 *   gesture.
 * @param rotaryScrollableBehavior Parameter for changing rotary behavior. By default rotary support
 *   is disabled for [HorizontalPager]. It can be enabled by passing
 *   [RotaryScrollableDefaults.snapBehavior] with pagerState parameter.
 * @param content A composable function that defines the content of each page displayed by the
 *   Pager. This is where the UI elements that should appear within each page should be placed.

     *   applied to.
     * @param pagerSnapDistance A way to control the snapping destination for this [Pager]. Use
     *   [PagerSnapDistance.atMost] to define a maximum number of pages this [Pager] is allowed to
     *   fling after scrolling is finished and fling has started.
     * @param decayAnimationSpec The animation spec used to approach the target offset. When the
     *   fling velocity is large enough. Large enough means large enough to naturally decay. For
     *   single page snapping this usually never happens since there won't be enough space to run a
     *   decay animation.
     * @param snapAnimationSpec The animation spec used to finally snap to the position. This
     *   animation will be often used in 2 cases: 1) There was enough space to an approach
     *   animation, the Pager will use [snapAnimationSpec] in the last step of the animation to
     *   settle the page into position. 2) There was not enough space to run the approach animation.
     *   By default a Spring animation with no bounciness and high stiffness is used to ensure the
     *   Pager settles quickly so that contents are focused and clickable.
     * @param snapPositionalThreshold If the fling has a low velocity (e.g. slow scroll), this fling
     *   behavior will use this snap threshold in order to determine if the pager should snap back
     *   or move forward. Use a number between 0 and 1 as a fraction of the page size that needs to
     *   be scrolled before the Pager considers it should move to the next page. For instance, if
     *   snapPositionalThreshold = 0.35, it means if this pager is scrolled with a slow velocity and
     *   the Pager scrolls more than 35% of the page size, then will jump to the next page, if not
     *   it scrolls back. Note that any fling that has high enough velocity will *always* move to
     *   the next page in the direction of the fling.
