/**
 * Provides a fixed set of stock [BrushFamily] objects that any app can use.
 *
 * All brush designs are versioned, so apps can safely store input points and brush specs instead of
 * the pixel result, but be able to regenerate strokes from stored input points that look like the
 * strokes originally drawn by the user. Brush designs are intended to evolve over time, and are
 * released as update packs to the stock library.
 *
 * Each successive brush version will keep to the spirit of the brush, but the actual effect can
 * change between versions. For example, a new version of the highlighter may introduce a variation
 * on how round the tip is, or what sort of curve maps color to pressure.
 *
 * We generally recommend that applications use the latest brush version available; but some use
 * cases, such as art, should be careful to track which version of a brush was used if the document
 * is regenerated, so that the user gets the same visual result.
